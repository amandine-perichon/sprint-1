Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command line allows you to give commands to a computer. Commands consist of one line of text. They are given to the computer through the Terminal application. Open the Terminal application, type your command, type enter, and the computer will action the command. An example of a command you can give to your computer would be to display all of the files in your documents folder. In command line, listing files in a folder is done by using the command "ls".

 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

 1. ls - displays the list of files in the current directory

 2. cd test-directory - change your current directory to test-directory

 3. pwd - displays the name of the current directory in the Terminal

 4. touch test.txt - creates a new empty file with the name test.txt

 5. open test.txt - open the file named text.txt with the default application

 6. mv test.txt hello.txt - rename file test.txt into hello.txt

 7. cp test.txt hello.txt - copy the content of test.txt into hello.txt

 8. rm test.txt - deletes file test.txt
